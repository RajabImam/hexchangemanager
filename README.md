The purpose of the Home Management system is to ease home management and to create a convenient and easy-to-use application that allows individuals 
to exchange their homes(apartment, house, loft, etc.) for a short vacation (a day to a few weeks). 
The system is based on a relational database with its booking management and reservation functions.
